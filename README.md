# Mercato-auction-
This is a side project developped during my master thesis and possible ground for future works.
Study the value of knowing other captains estimate during a mercato type auction, i.e., you all have players to buy from a pool, the true utility they'll bring to your team is known only up to an estimate drawn from a normal law with their utility as mean and an estimation error as variance.
Namely, the code provided in here allows to play that kind of aucton either against other humans, or against a computer with different set of rules or difficulty.
A dynamic programming approach allows to solve this game quite easily, the real interest here is to derivate how much edge you gain by knowing what your opponents estimate of the value of the players in the pool is.
For that I tested how well an optimal strategy would do against computers with higher budget and other rules in their favor. 

This project was let on standby during my master thesis, focusing more on the implementatiojn of a second price auction on blockchains which ended being the sole subject of my paper, I intend to come back to it someday though as I thinkit is a fun and interesting approach to multi items auctions.
